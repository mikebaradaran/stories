   <h1>Story of the big Fox</h1>
<pre>
The big fox ran. 
The sun was hot. 

The fox saw two red hats.
<hr />
One hat for you, the fox said. One hat for me!
<hr />
The fox put his hat on. 
The hat was too big!
<hr />
Oh no! The hat hid his eye. 
The fox ran and hit a log.
<hr />
Are you OK? a cat said.
<hr />
Yes, but my hat is not! 
The fox sat and cut the hat.
<hr />
Now it is fit! 
The fox was so happy!

The end!
