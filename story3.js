Princess Bella was having a sleepover at her cosy castle. Her best friend Lorenzo was already there, wearing his soft pajamas and holding his favourite teddy bear.

Another good friend, a little princess named Kimberly, came too! She wore a crown with pink glitter and brought her bedtime bunny.

Before bedtime, Princess Bella said,
"It is almost time to sleep!"

But Kimberly remembered something very important.
"I need to brush my teeth!" she said.

She took her toothbrush and brushed side to side, side to side, just like she was taught. Sparkle! Sparkle! Her teeth were clean and shiny.

When they were all snuggled in their blankets, Princess Bella used a little magic to help everyone sleep. She whispered sleepy words and waved her glowing wand.

But—oh no! too much magic!
A little puff of sparkles filled the room, and everyone gave a tiny cough cough!
"Oops!" giggled Bella. "Too much sparkle!"

They all laughed, then cuddled up again. This time, Bella used just a little magic, and soon, everyone was fast asleep… dreaming of unicorns, pancakes, and flying kittens.

The End.`;
